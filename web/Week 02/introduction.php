	<h2>Hello Everyone, my name is Domenick Casper. I am
		from a small town North of Sacramento, called Lincoln. 
		I served my Mission in the New York, New York North Mission. I love New York so very much, and I can't wait to visit it again. Some of my hobbies include playing guitar, listening to music, watching movies, and my all time favorite, Playing Video Games. I play video games a lot more than I should but it all works out. I would love to play video games professionally, or I want to become a game developer. My favorite video game: Overwatch!
